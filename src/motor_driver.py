@file motor_driver.py
This file contains code that creates a class to control a motor for ME-405 Lab01. The class was then imported to the board for testing as motor_driver.py.
The motor is first initilzied, setting up the pins needed to control the motor, and then can the duty cycle and direction of the motor can be controlled. 
Test code is included in the bottom of this file that will not run when this file is imported to the board.
