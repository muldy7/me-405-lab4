@file controller.py

This file contains code to create a controller class that allows us to create a control loop to run our motor.
This controller class when used in conjuction with our motor_driver and encoder_reader classes allow use to implement 
closed loop porportional control of our motor. The class below includes function to init and run out controller, 
along with setting the setpoint and Kp value of the control loop.
